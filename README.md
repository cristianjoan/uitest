# About This test

I always think that this kind of evaluation are the perfect situation to challenge my skills, in this opportunity I chose to use VueJs for the test because in my current work I use Angular, so was my first time doing some vue app for an external person.

I implemented vuex to store states, and to store the states in local storage I installed vuex-persistedstate (great plugin)
I try to cover all the resolutions, but I have a tech debt with the iPhone 5 view due to time.

thanks!
